# Arknights-Lua-Decryptor

## Requirements

```
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/n0k0m3/Arknights-Lua-Decrypter.git
cd Arknights-Lua-Decrypter
# Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/)
# curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
# Install dependecies
poetry install
```

## Usage

```
poetry run python decryption.py [path_to_encrypted_data_folder]
```

## Notes

Use `decryption.py` to encrypt/decrypt Arknights (AK) lua.

Note that Arknights has a very robust hash checking system so if you know how to bypass that, please share them with me
(APK modding, which I'm against when modding any mobage)

This is now a tool for AK data mining. You can also just get the dump from `https://github.com/Dimbreath/ArknightsData` instead

Note: `jsontest.py` is just my playground file, ignore it.

PM Discord n0k0m3#3179 if you have any question (note that I'm not obliged to answer all of them though)
